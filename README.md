# VoteRewards
Vote Rewards is a simple plugin to reward your players when they vote for your server. Vote Rewards contains many features like fakevote or voteparty. I promise that the Vote Rewards will not cause problems to your server and if you have a bug you can report it to the Discussion section or send me a private message


# Compiling
1. Make a new project in Intellij or Eclipse
2. Import the sources
(import the libraries and whatever else is needed)
3. Export

I uploaded the source code so that everyone can make their own modifications

You can use the source code to do whatever you want but do not upload somewhere without my permission
